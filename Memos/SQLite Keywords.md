# SQLite Keywords

The list below shows all possible keywords used by any build of SQLite regardless of compile-time options.  Regardless of the compile-time configuration, any identifier that is not on the following 147-element list is not a keyword to the SQL parser in SQLite:

If you want to use a keyword as a name, you need to quote it. There are four ways of quoting keywords in SQLite:

```
'keyword'	-- A keyword in single quotes is a string literal.
"keyword"	-- A keyword in double-quotes is an identifier.
[keyword]	-- A keyword enclosed in square brackets is an identifier. This is not standard SQL. This quoting mechanism is used by MS Access and SQL Server and is included in SQLite for compatibility.
`keyword`	-- A keyword enclosed in grave accents (ASCII code 96) is an identifier. This is not standard SQL. This quoting mechanism is used by MySQL and is included in SQLite for compatibility.
```
